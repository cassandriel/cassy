        <h2>Project reConnect</h2>
        <p>I'm <em>cassy</em> and looking to connect with new artists or reconnect with previous artists that I've worked with. My dream for this site is to produce cool stuff. However, like most dreams, it takes time and I can't do it alone. I am building a platform that's expandable to bigger and better ventures.</p>

        <p>If you are a struggling artist, reach out to me. Let's chat. I have experience with these kinds of things. If things work out and my platform grows, you could be here for the next big thing! All of this effort is completely out of my own pockets and I have student loans, so forgive the slowness.</p>

        <p>For the record, I am &#9794; (so stop flirting with me!) and Cassandriel is a nickname and cassy is short for it. Anyway, reach out to me and we can talk about making cool stuff happen!</p>
